# Hayden Tinker's portfolio website! 
- URL: https://haydentinker.com/
- I built this website using React with Material Ui and React Three Fiber. My overall design goal for this website was to create a clean portfolio website that will allow user's to not only learn more about my experience and projects but, also learn more about my personality and interests.
- I decided to use Material Ui because it provides a simple way of keeping track of the themes throughout the website. 
- For the hero section I wanted to have something really cool that will catch the user's attention when they first interact with my website so that is why I decided to use React Three Fiber to create 3D objects. Here is a picture of the 3D Objects: ![image](https://github.com/haydentinker/portfolio_website/assets/37011292/3e30ca20-0b76-4bf0-a447-bd7a6e954ced)
- If you would like to run the website locally, you can download the repository then run the docker-compose up -d command within the portfolio_website folder If you would like to use the production version of the website locally run the command docker-compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d. The npm start command may work depending on your environment but I would recommend using docker.
- The tests were made with a combination of vitest and jest.
